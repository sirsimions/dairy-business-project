#### By **Simion Okola**
## Description
The present web app accepts inputs (such as time, price) from farmers and use them as predictors to estimate future performance.This aplication is designed to help dairy farmers project milk output as well as potential returns from milk production. The app has inbuilt mathematical tools that facilitate linear estimation for days, months, and years. With this application, dairy farmers can make informed strategic descision based on the estimates.
